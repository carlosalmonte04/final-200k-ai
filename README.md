# Hidden Correlations Analysis

## Overview

Final project for Codecademy in order to receive certificate for Machine Learning/AI Engineer course.

## Project Objective

This project aims to discover a seemingly unrelated metric that impacts another seemingly unrelated metricâ€”similar to how a butterfly flapping its wings in Japan may have repercussions elsewhere on the planet.

Through advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques, I seek to uncover hidden correlations and causal relationships between disparate metrics that may not be immediately apparent through conventional analysis.
